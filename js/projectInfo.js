The goal is to manipulate your light and the light of NPCs to activate or not activate switches so you can make it to the end of the level."},

Other than that I worked on various small parts as the game progressed, one significant one being the implementation of moving blocks, and their ability to move the player with them if the player is standing on top of them."}

		{name: "Goal", info: "The main goal of our app was to make finding a mentor or mentee an easier and quicker process to encourage more people to seek mentorship while in university."},
		{name: "Field Study", info: "To get an idea of what students would find useful in the app, we first interviewed students who had been mentors or mentees and asked them what they did and didn't like about their mentorship experiences, and what they would look for in a mentorship app. (PUT FINDINGS HERE)"},
		{name: "Prototypes", info: "Based on the results of our field studies, we created two prototype interfaces. We initially made drafts of the interfaces in Figma, and later made more robust prototypes using HTML/CSS and Javascript. NEW LINE HERE. Prototype #1 was a traditional interface inspired by linkedin, mentees could search a list of mentors and message those that had relevant experiences/interests to them. Mentors on the other hand just waited to be messaged by mentees. \n Interface #2 had mentees submit questions to a question board, and then mentors would swipe through cards of these questions, swiping right and answering those they were interested in, and swiping left on those they were not. When mentors answered questions, a conversation in the messaging portion of the app was started between them and the question asker, allowing them to continue talking if they wanted."},
		{name: "Experiment", info: "To determine which of our two prototypes users preferred, we ran an experiment where we asked various students assigned to play the role of a mentor or mentee to use both interfaces, and participate in an interview about their experience afterwards. \n We hypothesized that mentees would prefer interface #1 as it gives them more choice in mentors, while mentors would prefer interface #2 as it lets them play a more active role instead of just waiting around until they are messaged. While we did get data that somewhat aligned with our hypotheses, we unfortunately had too small of a sample size to make any strong claims about which interface was preferred by either group."}

		{name: "Description", info: "Drop is a procedurally generated platforming game I worked on on-and-off from 2015 to 2017. The concept of the game is just that the player runs through procedurally generated enemy-filled dungeons, killing enemies along the way and trying to get to the end of each level. Occasionally the player will also have to defeat bosses to proceed to the next level. The game was made by me as a solo project, in Java using the libGDX game engine. I used libGDX for basic things like updating, getting keyboard input, and rendering, but everything else (such as physics and collision detection) was implemented from scratch."},
		{name: "Procedural Generation", info: "One of the most interesting parts of making this game was figuring out how to procedurally generate levels that are playable and interesting without being too repetitive. A common method of procedural generation (found in games such as Rogue Legacy and The Binding of Isaac) is to have a fixed set of premade rooms, and just connect the rooms to one another in a random way. This typically results in the levels being interesting, but due there being a limited number of premate rooms the player is bound to see one more than once eventually, which can lead to the game feeling more repetitive. I aimed to have a hybrid of this strategy and one where the level is completely random, by first having an algorithm find a random path through a 2D array, then having every element in the 2D array represent a chunk of blocks. This ended up in very random paths but due to each part of the path being an empty X-by-X chunk, the path wasn't very interesting. To attempt to remedy this, I made it so there were set layouts for chunks that were on the path, and each chunk on the path would be given a randomly selected layout of blocks to make things more interesting."}

The goal of this refactor was two-fold: The first goal was to make it less likely for developers to accidentally add elements without letting them be brand-customizable, and the second was to standardize the styling used across the platform (colors, spacing, etc) so the platform looked more visually consistent."}
